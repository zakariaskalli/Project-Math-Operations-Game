# ðŸŽ² Math Operations Game â€“ Console Application (C++)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

**Math Operations Game** is an interactive console-based quiz application developed in C++. It challenges players to solve arithmetic questions generated dynamically based on chosen difficulty levels and operation types. The game offers a flexible and engaging way to practice basic math skills such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Designed with clarity and modularity in mind, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like enumerations, random number generation, input validation, and struct-based data managementâ€”all implemented in a clean and maintainable functional style.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Deep Dive

### 1. Dynamic Question Generation

- **Difficulty Levels:**  
  Players can choose from four levels â€” *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard*, or *Mixed*.  
  - *Easy* questions use numbers between 1 and 10.  
  - *Medium* questions use numbers between 10 and 50.  
  - *Hard* questions use numbers between 50 and 100.  
  - *Mixed* randomly selects any of the above levels per question.

- **Operation Types:**  
  The game supports five operation modes:  
  - Addition (+)  
  - Subtraction (-)  
  - Multiplication (x)  
  - Division (/)  
  - Mixed (randomly selects one operation per question)

- **Randomized Questions:**  
  Questions are generated at runtime with randomized operands and operations (if mixed), ensuring a unique gameplay experience every time.

### 2. User-Driven Customization

- Players specify the number of questions (between 1 and 10), preferred difficulty, and the operation type before starting.
- The program validates inputs and prompts until correct choices are made, enhancing robustness and user experience.

### 3. Structured Data Management

- Uses **structs** (`stQuestion` and `stQuizz`) to encapsulate all relevant data:
  - `stQuestion` stores operands, operation type, correct answer, user answer, and correctness status.
  - `stQuizz` manages the collection of questions, tracks the number of right/wrong answers, quiz settings, and pass/fail result.

### 4. Real-Time Feedback & UI Enhancement

- After each answer, the player immediately receives feedback:
  - Correct answers keep the screen color green.
  - Wrong answers trigger a red screen color with a beep alert and display the correct answer.
- The use of console color changes (`system("color XY")`) visually engages the player and improves accessibility.

### 5. Pass/Fail Evaluation

- The game computes the final result based on the number of correct versus incorrect answers.
- Passing requires at least as many correct answers as wrong ones.
- Detailed summary shows number of questions, difficulty level, operation type, and counts of correct/incorrect answers.

### 6. Replayability

- After finishing a quiz, players can choose to replay or exit.
- The quiz resets cleanly with screen clearing and color reset, providing a smooth continuous experience.
